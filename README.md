# VR_IoT_Thesis
This project aimed at developing, implementing, and evaluating a virtual reality environment tailored to enhance the educational experiences of IoT students at Ashesi University. The study aims to improve the experience of a simple IoT lab experiment or assignment. The lab task involves turning on an LED bulb connected to an ESP32 microcontroller. With online and remote learning being a key part of this research, the
methodology models a scenario where the user (student) is in the comfort of their home, hostel
room or any place of convenience and is attempting to carry out the lab experiment.
